# Project Euler

## Problem: Even Fibonacci

- Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
    - 1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89...
- By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Instructions
- Code your procedural solution into the `lib/even_fibonacci.rb` file.
- Code your object-oriented solution into the `lib/oo_even_fibonacci.rb` file.
- Run your `rspec` test suite, and make each RSpec test pass.
