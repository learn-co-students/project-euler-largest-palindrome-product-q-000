## Problem

What is the largest palindrome product of two three-digit numbers?

## Background

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. For instance, `101` is a palindrome, as is `91,519` and `1,111`. 

For example, The largest palindrome made from the product of two two-digit numbers is 9009:

```
91 * 99
# => 9009
```

Your objective is to find the largest palindrome made from the product of two three-digit numbers.

## Instructions

- Code your procedural solution into the `lib/largest_palindrome_product.rb` file.
- Code your object-oriented solution into the `lib/oo_largest_palindrome_product.rb` file.
- Run `learn` until you get all of the RSpec tests to pass.
